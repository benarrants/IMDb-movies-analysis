# IMDb-movies-analysis
## Obective
IMDB is an online database for information on many types of media consumption, but here the focus is on movies.

The goal is to test the Hypothesis of: Revenue can be optimized for a film.

## Data

Contains 7667 movies scraped from IMDB that consists of information like mpaa rating, genre, runtime, IMDb scores and votes, cast and crew, as well as budget and gross revenue.

Dataset is available on [(Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies)

## Exploratory Questions other than the Hypthesis
1. What are the most profitable movies?
2. What are the least profitable movies?
3. What’s the most profitable genre?
4. What’s the least profitable genre?
5. What is the relationship between budget and revenue?

## Next Steps
Analysis yielded uncertain results, and there are questions left unanswered as to the full scope and ability to confirm the Hypothesis as True.

In the future, analysis could ideally include variables such as ticket price, premiere date, and streaming platform (if applicable). This would require an additional dataset.

There's also unanswered questions that were not addressed in this analysis with the available dataset simple due to scope and time, such as:
1. What is the most successful company?
2. Is there a year more, or less, profitable than the others?
3. Have companies seen significant changes in revenue over time?
4. Have countries seen significant changes in revenue over time?
